Algorithm
---------

1. **Import Dependencies**
  - Imports `print_function` for Python 2/3 compatibility, `re` for regular expressions, `product` from `itertools` for Cartesian products, and `oxidation_state_db` as `db` from an external module.

2. **parse_molecule_list_with_oxidation_states(reactant_str, product_str)**
  - Parses reactant and product molecule strings, assigning possible oxidation states to each element.
  - **Steps:**
    - Splits reactant and product strings by `' + '` to get individual molecules.
    - For each molecule:
      - Extracts the overall charge using regex (e.g., `^2-`).
      - Parses element symbols and their counts from the formula.
      - Looks up possible oxidation states for each element from the database `db`.
      - Uses Cartesian product to generate all possible oxidation state combinations.
      - Filters combinations where the sum of (oxidation state Ã— atom count) equals the molecule's charge.
      - Selects the combination with the highest sum of weighted oxidation states.
    - Returns two lists (for reactants and products), each containing tuples of (oxidation_state_dict, molecule_str). If no valid assignment is found, oxidation_state_dict is `None`.

3. **list_of_half_reactions(reactants_list, products_list)**
  - Generates a list of half-reactions based on changes in element counts between reactants and products.
  - **Steps:**
    - Iterates over all pairs of reactant and product molecules.
    - For each element present in both, compares their counts.
    - If the count differs, records a dictionary mapping (reactant_str, product_str) to a tuple: (element, delta, reactant_count, product_count).
    - Returns a list of such dictionaries.

4. **print_half_reactions(half_list)**
  - Prints formatted half-reactions (oxidation and reduction) from a list of reaction entries.
  - **Steps:**
    - Iterates through each entry in `half_list`.
    - For each, checks if the reaction has already been printed.
    - Determines if the reaction is oxidation (oxidation state increases) or reduction (oxidation state decreases).
    - Prints the half-reaction, indicating the element, oxidation states, number of electrons transferred, and the type (oxidation or reduction).

5. **main()**
  - Entry point for the program.
  - **Steps:**
    - Defines a sample redox reaction string.
    - Splits the reaction into reactants and products.
    - Parses reactants and products to assign oxidation states.
    - Generates a list of half-reactions.
    - Prints the formatted half-reactions.

6. **Program Entry Point**
  - If the script is run as the main module, executes `main()`.

Algorithm for main() Function
-----------------------------

1. Define the Chemical Formula
  - Set `chemical` to the chemical species string to be analyzed (e.g., "MnO4^1-").

2. Print the Chemical Formula
  - Output the chemical formula being parsed for user context.

3. Parse the Chemical Formula
  - Call `parse(chemical)` to obtain the oxidation states of the elements in the species.

4. Display Results
  - If a valid oxidation state combination is found, print each element and its oxidation state.
  - If no valid combination is found, notify the user.

Variables Used
--------------

- `chemical`: The chemical species string to be parsed (e.g., "MnO4^1-").
- `result`: The dictionary mapping element symbols to their oxidation states, or `None` if not found.

Functions Used
--------------

- `parse(reactants)`: Parses the chemical formula, extracts element counts, and computes oxidation states.
- `oxidation_state(species, charge)`: Determines the most likely oxidation states for the elements given their counts and the overall charge.
- `find_charge(reactant_species)`: Extracts the ionic charge from the chemical formula string.
- `get_possible_oxidation_states(symbol)`: (Imported) Returns possible oxidation states for a given element symbol.

Function and Variable Explanations
----------------------------------

- `parse(reactants)`: Uses regular expressions to extract element symbols and their counts (considering coefficients), then calls `oxidation_state` to assign oxidation states.
- `oxidation_state(species, charge)`: Tries all combinations of possible oxidation states for the elements, selecting the one that matches the total charge and maximizes a heuristic score.
- `find_charge(reactant_species)`: Looks for charge notation (e.g., "^2-") in the formula and returns the charge as an integer.
- `get_possible_oxidation_states(symbol)`: Returns a list of possible oxidation states for the given element (from an external database).
- `chemical`: The input chemical formula string.
- `result`: The output dictionary of element: oxidation state pairs, or `None` if no valid combination is found.

Summary
-------

The code provides a framework for analyzing redox reactions. It parses reactant and product molecules, assigns oxidation states using a database, identifies changes in element counts, and prints formatted half-reactions indicating oxidation and reduction processes. The `main()` function coordinates the parsing and oxidation state determination for a given chemical species. It prints the results or notifies the user if no valid oxidation state assignment is possible. Helper functions handle parsing, charge extraction, and oxidation state assignment using possible values from a database. All variables and functions used in the process are listed above for clarity.
