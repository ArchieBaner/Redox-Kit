Algorithm
---------

1. **Import Dependencies**
    - Imports `print_function` for Python 2/3 compatibility, `re` for regular expressions, `product` from `itertools` for Cartesian products, and `oxidation_state_db` as `db` from an external module.

2. **parse_molecule_list_with_oxidation_states(reactant_str, product_str)**
    - Parses reactant and product molecule strings, assigning possible oxidation states to each element.
    - **Steps:**
        - Splits reactant and product strings by `' + '` to get individual molecules.
        - For each molecule:
            - Extracts the overall charge using regex (e.g., `^2-`).
            - Parses element symbols and their counts from the formula.
            - Looks up possible oxidation states for each element from the database `db`.
            - Uses Cartesian product to generate all possible oxidation state combinations.
            - Filters combinations where the sum of (oxidation state Ã— atom count) equals the molecule's charge.
            - Selects the combination with the highest sum of weighted oxidation states.
        - Returns two lists (for reactants and products), each containing tuples of (oxidation_state_dict, molecule_str). If no valid assignment is found, oxidation_state_dict is `None`.

3. **list_of_half_reactions(reactants_list, products_list)**
    - Generates a list of half-reactions based on changes in element counts between reactants and products.
    - **Steps:**
        - Iterates over all pairs of reactant and product molecules.
        - For each element present in both, compares their counts.
        - If the count differs, records a dictionary mapping (reactant_str, product_str) to a tuple: (element, delta, reactant_count, product_count).
        - Returns a list of such dictionaries.

4. **print_half_reactions(half_list)**
    - Prints formatted half-reactions (oxidation and reduction) from a list of reaction entries.
    - **Steps:**
        - Iterates through each entry in `half_list`.
        - For each, checks if the reaction has already been printed.
        - Determines if the reaction is oxidation (oxidation state increases) or reduction (oxidation state decreases).
        - Prints the half-reaction, indicating the element, oxidation states, number of electrons transferred, and the type (oxidation or reduction).

5. **main()**
    - Entry point for the program.
    - **Steps:**
        - Defines a sample redox reaction string.
        - Splits the reaction into reactants and products.
        - Parses reactants and products to assign oxidation states.
        - Generates a list of half-reactions.
        - Prints the formatted half-reactions.

6. **Program Entry Point**
    - If the script is run as the main module, executes `main()`.

Summary
-------
The code provides a framework for analyzing redox reactions. It parses reactant and product molecules, assigns oxidation states using a database, identifies changes in element counts, and prints formatted half-reactions indicating oxidation and reduction processes. Helper functions handle parsing, oxidation state assignment, and output formatting. All variables and functions used in the process are listed above for clarity.
