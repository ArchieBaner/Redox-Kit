Redox Toolkit
-------------
A collection of standalone tools for redox chemistry:

- **A_OxStateFinder**  
    Determines oxidation states in molecules/radicals/ions.

- **B_RedoxChangeDetector**  
    Detects redox changes between reactants and products in a given reaction 

- **C_HalfReactionGenerator**  
    Generates half-reactions for redox processes.

- **D_RedoxBalancer**  
    Balances redox equations automatically.

> **Note:**  
> Each tool is a standalone sub-repo with its own `main.py` file. There are no inter-dependencies between them.
