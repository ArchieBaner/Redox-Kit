Algorithm
---------

1. **Import Dependencies**
    - Imports required modules and functions: `print_function` for Python 2/3 compatibility, `re` for regular expressions, `product` from `itertools` for Cartesian products, and `oxidation_state_db` as `db` from an external module.

2. **Define the Reaction String**
    - Set `reaction_str` to the unbalanced redox reaction as a string.

3. **Print the Reaction**
    - Output the reaction being balanced for user context.

4. **Parse Reactants and Products**
    - Split `reaction_str` into `reactant_str` and `product_str` using `' = '` as the delimiter.

5. **Annotate with Oxidation States**
    - Call `parse_molecule_list_with_oxidation_states(reactant_str, product_str)` to obtain:
        - `list_of_reactants_w_oxs`: List of reactant species with oxidation states.
        - `list_of_products_w_oxs`: List of product species with oxidation states.
    - **Details:**
        - Splits reactant and product strings by `' + '` to get individual molecules.
        - For each molecule:
            - Extracts the overall charge using regex (e.g., `^2-`).
            - Parses element symbols and their counts from the formula.
            - Looks up possible oxidation states for each element from the database `db`.
            - Uses Cartesian product to generate all possible oxidation state combinations.
            - Filters combinations where the sum of (oxidation state × atom count) equals the molecule's charge.
            - Selects the combination with the highest sum of weighted oxidation states.
        - Returns two lists (for reactants and products), each containing tuples of (oxidation_state_dict, molecule_str). If no valid assignment is found, oxidation_state_dict is `None`.

6. **Generate Half-Reactions**
    - Call `list_of_half_reactions(list_of_reactants_w_oxs, list_of_products_w_oxs)` to obtain:
        - `half_reactions`: List of tuples representing oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
    - **Details:**
        - Iterates over all pairs of reactant and product molecules.
        - For each element present in both, compares their counts.
        - If the count differs, records a dictionary mapping (reactant_str, product_str) to a tuple: (element, delta, reactant_count, product_count).
        - Returns a list of such dictionaries.

7. **Print Half-Reactions**
    - Call `print_half_reactions(half_reactions)` to output formatted half-reactions.
    - **Details:**
        - Iterates through each entry in `half_reactions`.
        - For each, checks if the reaction has already been printed.
        - Determines if the reaction is oxidation (oxidation state increases) or reduction (oxidation state decreases).
        - Prints the half-reaction, indicating the element, oxidation states, number of electrons transferred, and the type (oxidation or reduction).

8. **Balance Main Atoms (Optional/Planned)**
    - Call `balance_main_atoms(half_reactions)` to obtain:
        - `balanced_main`: Half-reactions with the main redox atoms balanced.

9. **Balance Oxygen (Optional/Planned)**
    - Call `balance_oxygen(balanced_main)` to obtain:
        - `balanced_oxygen`: Half-reactions with oxygen atoms balanced by adding H₂O.

10. **Balance Hydrogen (Optional/Planned)**
    - (Implied) Call a function to balance hydrogen, likely by adding H⁺ for acidic solutions.

11. **Balance Charge (Optional/Planned)**
    - (Implied) Call a function to balance the charge by adding electrons.

12. **Print Results**
    - Output the balanced half-reactions and the final balanced redox equation.

Summary
-------
The `main()` function orchestrates the step-by-step balancing of a redox reaction using the half-reaction method. It leverages helper functions for parsing, annotation, and balancing at each stage. Each variable holds the intermediate state of the reaction as it progresses through parsing, annotation, and balancing steps. The code provides a framework for analyzing redox reactions: parsing molecules, assigning oxidation states, identifying changes, and printing formatted half-reactions. Helper functions handle parsing, oxidation state assignment, and output formatting. All variables and functions used in the process are listed above for clarity.
